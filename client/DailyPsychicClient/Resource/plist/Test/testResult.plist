When we compare ourselves to other things in this world, we just add to the weird and wonderful parts of it. You like your egg scrambled and hate routine. Life is a rollercoaster for you and most people don’t understand your lifestyle and what you do as you have stepped out of your comfort zone and stepped into the weirdness.</string>

You wouldn’t miss a night without brushing your teeth or go a week without washing your bed sheets if your life depended on it. You love structure and routine and this is what keeps you on the right path. You can’t roll your tongue and you should be grateful that you have not been mixed with alien beings that make that ability possible. Being normal is by no means a bad thing; it just means you are part of select part of society and move along with it wherever life takes you.</string>
